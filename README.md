# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  Artemis Financial wanted to moderize their software operations.  Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application in which they want to use the latest and most effective software security.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  I enjoyed reading the different vulnerabilities in the client's code.  It is critical to secure all
  personal information transmitted to protect the clients and the company.  Coding secure software protects the company's reputation and their client's information. 
  
# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The dependency check file was helpful.  This file identified most of not all vulnerabilities the software would encounter.  In addition, some vulnerabilities could be handled by updating 
  the software version.  A challenge for me was when the dependency check file did not generate and/or the compile error was not readily identifiable.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I increased layers of security by encryption using the hash function and bytesToHex function.  In the future, I would continue to use these techniques in addition to add other 
  encryption and decryption code as needed.  As I am learning more about vulnerabilities, I will use the most up-to-date techniques to ensure the best security for my clients.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ran into some challenges during the coding process; however, with persistence and patience I was able to debug the code and re-compile until the code ran as desired.  After refactoring
  the code, I ran pom.xlm file to find existing vulnerabilities.  If I changed the code, I would run the pom.xlm file again for any new vulnerabilities.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  After compiling the code, I read the console for errors and warnings.  I also consulted with my professor on error messages that seem to be out of my control.  She was able to find
  that the Java version I was using as not compatible to the updated version I was using.  It was suggested I use an older version that would be compatible to the code supplied.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would use demonstrate how the hash function encrypts data.
